****User Stories****
Our user is someone on-the-go seeking advise. 
Our app will be a one-stop-shop that offers many different types of wisdom and advice. 
Whether you need a daily horoscope, a reading from a fortune teller or words of wisdom from a magic-8 ball, 
you are covered. Also, the user may log back into their account to see past dated readings.

***How****
Under the hood, our app is full stack. It will appear to be one page, but we will use routes and a 
navigation bar to bring up our other pages. We will have hard coded data in our mongo db, and use javascript 
logic to generate random quotes and hit Stretch. We will use mernAuth to secure the user's data. We will be working 
in react and use CSS to style.
