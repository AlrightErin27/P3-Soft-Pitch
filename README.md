Tomorrow morning we will be presenting soft pitches and working all day to plan out P3. Exciting!

## Review the Project Guidelines:

### Project Overview

You've already worked in small groups to accomplish various labs and exercises, but this time **we‚Äôre going to challenge you to work on a whole project with a small team.**

Not only will you be asked to **exercise additional creativity** in designing your own project, your instructors will partner you with other classmates to architect, design, and collaboratively build an application of your own design.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It‚Äôs a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself, but that's most likely what you'll be doing in your first development job after WDI, and **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

- **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own frontend
- **Use a MERN tech stack**, React for the frontend, with an express-node-mongo backend
- **Be a complete product**, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models. However, this is ultimately up to your discretion.
- **Use a database**, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
- **Implement thoughtful user stories** that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
- **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
- **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible. We will have a deploy jam during project week

### Completed Projects:

- A **working app, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github README.
- A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project.
- **A `README.md` file** with:
  - A screenshot of the site in repo's README
  - Explanations of the **technologies** used
  - A couple paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
  - **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
  - Link to your **user stories** ‚Äì who are your users, what do they want, and why?
  - Link to your **wireframes** ‚Äì sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
  - Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

## üèë Soft Pitch Guidelines:

---

This evening you and your team should finish developing your main app idea. Spend time researching and fleshing out the idea and your group workflow as per the [brainstorming deliverable](https://github.com/SEI-SEA-1-25/P3-Brainstorm) from yesterday.

Below are the instructions and guidelines for soft-pitching your Project 3 as a team. Please read through each section, and then spend time together (about an hour) crafting, refining, and practicing your pitch.

## Instructions:

Your team will be given ten minutes to pitch your idea to the instructional staff. _This pitch should include both a verbal pitch, and also a Readme (instructions below) provided to the instructional team._

![Meetings are the best](https://media.giphy.com/media/l46CsJcPAe3Fec6Iw/giphy.gif)

Please read the guidelines below on what should be included in your pitch and how the ten minutes you will be given should be used.

**If you have any additional questions please reach out to the instructional team over Slack**.

## Soft Pitch Readme Format:

Your soft pitch Readme should be included in a pull request to this repo.

The soft pitch Readme should contain the following information in an outline format:

1. Your team name
1. Your elevator pitch for your website (a quick 1-minute-max version of your pitch)
1. Your user stories
1. What technologies you plan on using
1. What your current status is on the project (including demos of the APIs and techs you would like to use)

## Soft Pitch Meeting Format:

Time Limit: 10 mins

1. **00:00 - 01:00: Elevator Pitch**

- Example format: _When TARGET USERS want/need THIS THING, I help provide them a solution by DOING THIS._ - [Kayla Abanda](https://kaylabanda.com/2020/03/09/the-easiest-way-to-create-a-killer-elevator-pitch/)
- A one- or two-sentence statement that conveys the why and how of your product.

- What data/information will you need from the user/third party sources?
- What tech stack are you using to achieve this?

4. **6:00 - 7:00: Resource Ask**

- _Resources: information, technical answers, and or time with Instructional Team/TAs_
- What resources do you need from instructors/TAs to complete the task at hand?
- If we give you resources, how will you go about using them/implementing them?

5. **7:00 - 10:00: Q&A with Instructional Staff**

- Three minutes for staff to ask questions related to pitch
